Etsy-Description-Translater
The Etsy Description translator is a small Python utility that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a shop listing descriptions translate them, and export them as PDFs. I created this as adding descriptions to other Amazon platforms such as Amazon.mx and .br can be extremely unpleasant as translating hundreds of descriptions is not logical.

There is no rate-limiting protection built in. However, I have not encountered any rate limits. Read about  `Etsy Ratelimits`_. This program does not use the official Etsy API and is solely for educational purposes.
