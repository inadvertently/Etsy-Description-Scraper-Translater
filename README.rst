Etsy-Description-Translater
==============

The Etsy Description translator is a small Python utility that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a shop listing descriptions translate them, and export them as PDFs. I created this as adding descriptions to other Amazon platforms such as Amazon.mx and .br can be extremely unpleasant as translating hundreds of descriptions is not logical.

There is no rate-limiting protection built in. However, I have not encountered any rate limits. Read about  `Etsy Ratelimits`_. This program does not use the official Etsy API and is solely for educational purposes.

üìö PDF Creator

- Filenames are set to match those of the listing title.
- Automatically centered, dependent on the character count and length of the translated description.

‚úèÔ∏è Scraper
================

Definitely could've done better in terms of organization and understanding here, though, this was mainly for personal use hence the carelessness of comprehension.

- Inspect Etsy's HTML to see if we're able to detect whether the shop has a paginated list of listings.
- Gather's description and title per listing.
- Removes special characters from Etsy listing titles as they may interfere with the PDF generation.
