# Etsy-Description-Translater
The Etsy Description translater is a small Python utility that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a shops listing descriptions translate them, and export them as PDF's. I created this as adding descriptions to other Amazon platforms such as Amazon.mx and .br can be extremely unpleasent as having to translate hundreds of descriptions is not logical.
